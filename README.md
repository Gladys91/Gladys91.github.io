### Course description

This course covers the principles of collecting, processing, and storing data with R. It also covers workflow management for typical data transformation and cleaning projects, frequently the starting point and most time-consuming part of any data science project.  We use a project-based learning approach towards the study of computation and some group-based collaboration, essential parts of modern data science work. We also make frequent use of version control and collaboration tools such as Git and GitHub.
